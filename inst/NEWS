    o   Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.52 'Monkey Wrench'

    o   src/fastLm.cpp: Switch from inv() to pinv() as inv() now tests for
        singular matrices and warns and returns an empty matrix which stops
        the example fastLm() implementation on the manual page -- and while
        this is generally reasonably it makes sense here to continue which
        the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse allows us to do this

0.2.3   2010-06-14

    o   Better configuration to detect suncc (which does not have std::isfinite)

        as a complex and an arma::mat, which have been introduced in
        armadillo 0.9.10
        
    o   Wrap support for mtGlue, i.e. operations involving matrices of mixed 
        types such as an arma::mat and an arma::imat, which have been introduced
        in armadillo 0.9.10
        
    o   Included an inline plugin to support the plugin system introduced
        in inline 0.3.5. The unit tests have moved from the src directory 
        to the unit test directory (similar to Rcpp) using cxxfunction with the
        RcppArmadillo plugin.

        methods for print, summary, predict to behave like a standard
        model fitting function

    o   Armadillo sources (using release 0.9.8) are now included in the
        package using a standardized build suitable for our purposes
        (not assuming Boost or Atlas) -- see ?RcppArmadillo for
        details
        
   o    New R function RcppArmadillo.package.skeleton, similar to
        Rcpp::Rcpp.package.skeleton, but targetting use of
        RcppArmadillo

0.1.0   2010-03-11

    o   the fastLm() implementation of a bare-bones lm() fit (using
        Armadillo's solve() function) provides an example of how
        efficient code can be written compactly using the combination
        of Rcpp, RcppAramadillo and Armadillo

    o   support for Rcpp implicit wrap of these types :
        Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T>, Cube<T> where T is one of : 
        int, unsigned int, double, float
        
    o   support for Rcpp implicit as of these types :
        Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T> where R is one of :
        int, unsigned int, double, float
