        singular matrices and warns and returns an empty matrix which stops
        the example fastLm() implementation on the manual page -- and while

    o   Wrap support for mtGlue, i.e. operations involving matrices of mixed 
        types such as an arma::mat and an arma::imat, which have been introduced
        in armadillo 0.9.10
        
    o   Included an inline plugin to support the plugin system introduced
        in inline 0.3.5. The unit tests have moved from the src directory 
        to the unit test directory (similar to Rcpp) using cxxfunction with the
        RcppArmadillo plugin.

        model fitting function

    o   Armadillo sources (using release 0.9.8) are now included in the
        package using a standardized build suitable for our purposes
        (not assuming Boost or Atlas) -- see ?RcppArmadillo for
        details

    o   support for Rcpp implicit wrap of these types :
        Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T>, Cube<T> where T is one of : 
        int, unsigned int, double, float
        
    o   support for Rcpp implicit as of these types :
        Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T> where R is one of :
        int, unsigned int, double, float
