  \itemize{
    \item Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.52 'Monkey Wrench'
    \item src/fastLm.cpp: Switch from inv() to pinv() as inv() now tests for singular matrices and warns and returns an empty matrix which stops the example fastLm() implementation on the manual page -- and while this is generally reasonably it makes sense here to continue which the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse allows us to do this

\section{Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.2.3 (2010-06-14)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Better configuration to detect suncc (which does not have std::isfinite)
  }
}
\section{Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.2.2 (2010-06-09)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added RcppArmadillo:::CxxFlags for cases where RcppArmadillo is not used via a package
    \item Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.10 'Chilli Espresso'
    \item Wrap support for mtOp, i.e. operations involving mixed types such as a complex and an arma::mat, which have been introduced in armadillo 0.9.10
    \item Wrap support for mtGlue, i.e. operations involving matrices of mixed types such as an arma::mat and an arma::imat, which have been introduced in armadillo 0.9.10
    \item Included an inline plugin to support the plugin system introduced in inline 0.3.5. The unit tests have moved from the src directory to the unit test directory (similar to Rcpp) using cxxfunction with the RcppArmadillo plugin.

\section{Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.2.1 (2010-05-19)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Bug-fix release permitting compilation on Windows
  }
}
\section{Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.2.0 (2010-05-18)}{
  \itemize{
    \item fastLm() is now generic and has a formula interface as well as methods for print, summary, predict to behave like a standard model fitting function
    \item Armadillo sources (using release 0.9.8) are now included in the package using a standardized build suitable for our purposes (not assuming Boost or Atlas) -- see ?RcppArmadillo for details
    \item New R function RcppArmadillo.package.skeleton, similar to Rcpp::Rcpp.package.skeleton, but targetting use of RcppArmadillo
  }
}
\section{Changes in RcppArmadillo version 0.1.0 (2010-03-11)}{
  \itemize{
    \item the fastLm() implementation of a bare-bones lm() fit (using Armadillo's solve() function) provides an example of how efficient code can be written compactly using the combination of Rcpp, RcppAramadillo and Armadillo
    \item support for Rcpp implicit wrap of these types : Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T>, Cube<T> where T is one of : int, unsigned int, double, float
    \item support for Rcpp implicit as of these types : Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T> where R is one of : int, unsigned int, double, float
