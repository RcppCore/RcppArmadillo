  \noindent
  The \proglang{R} statistical environment and language has demonstrated
  particular strengths for interactive development of statistical
  algorithms, as well as data modelling and visualisation.  Its current
  implementation has an interpreter at its core which may result in a
  performance penalty in comparison to directly executing user algorithms
  in the native machine code of the host CPU.  In contrast, the
  \proglang{C++} language has no built-in visualisation capabilities,
  handling of linear algebra or even basic statistical algorithms; however,
  user programs are converted to high-performance machine code, ahead of
  execution.
  %
  We present a new method of avoiding possible speed penalties in
  \proglang{R} by using the \pkg{Rcpp} extension package in conjunction
  with the \pkg{Armadillo} \Cpp matrix library.  In addition to the
  inherent performance advantages of compiled code, \pkg{Armadillo}
  provides an easy-to-use template-based meta-programming framework,
  allowing the automatic pooling of several linear algebra operations into
  one, which in turn can lead to further speedups.  We demonstrate that
  with the aid of \pkg{Rcpp} and \pkg{Armadillo}, conversion of linear
  algebra centered algorithms from \proglang{R} to \proglang{C++} becomes
  straightforward, with the algorithms retaining the overall structure as
  well as readability, all while maintaining a bidirectional link with the
  host R environment.  Empirical timing comparisons of \proglang{R} and
  \proglang{C++} implementations of a Kalman filtering algorithm indicate a
  speedup of several orders of magnitude.

\section{Overview}

Linear algebra is a cornerstone of statistical computing and statistical
software systems.  Various matrix decompositions, linear program solvers, and
eigenvalue / eigenvector computations are key to many estimation and analysis
routines.  As generally useful procedure, these are often abstracted and
regrouped in specific libraries for linear algebra which statistical
programmers have provided for various programming languages and environments.

One such environment (and statistical programming language) is R
\citep{R:Main}.  It has become a tool of choice for data analysis and applied
work in statistics \citep{Morandat_2012}.  While R has particular strengths
at fast prototyping and easy visualisation of data, its current
implementation has an interpreter at its core.  In comparison to running user
algorithms in the native machine code of the host CPU, the use of an
interpreter often results in a performance penalty for non-trivial algorithms
that perform elaborate data manipulation \citep{Morandat_2012}.  With user
algorithms becoming more complex and increasing in functionality, as well as
with data sets which continue to increase in size, the issue of execution
speed becomes more important.

The \Cpp language offers a complementary set of attributes: while it has no
built-in visualisation capabilities nor handling of linear algebra or
statistical methods, user programs are converted to high-performance machine
code ahead of execution.  It is also inherently flexible. One key feature is
\textit{operator overloading} which allows the programmer to define custom
behaviour for mathematical operators such as $+$, $-$, $*$
\citep{Meyers:2005:EffectiveC++}.  \Cpp also provides language constructs
known as {\it templates}, originally intended to easily allow the reuse of
algorithms for various object types, and later extended to a programming
construct in its own right called \textit{template meta-programming}
\citep{Vandevoorde_2002,Abrahams_2004}

Operator overloading allows mathematical operations to be extended to
user-defined objects, such as matrices.  This in turn allows linear algebra
expressions to be written in a more natural manner (eg.~\mbox{$X = 0.1*A +
  0.2*B$}), rather than the far less readable traditional function call
syntax, eg.~\mbox{$X = \mbox{\it add}(\mbox{\it multiply}(0.1,A), \mbox{\it
    multiply}(0.2,B))$}.

Template meta-programming is the process of inducing the \Cpp compiler to
execute, at compile time, Turing-complete programs written in a somewhat
opaque subset of the \Cpp language~\citep{Vandevoorde_2002,Abrahams_2004}.
These meta-programs in effect generate further \Cpp code (often specialised
for particular object types), which is finally converted into machine code.

An early and influential example of exploiting both meta-programming and
overloading of mathematical operators was provided by the Blitz++ library
\citep{Veldhuizen:1998:Blitz}, targeted for efficient processing of arrays.
Blitz++ employed elaborate meta-programming to avoid the generation of
temporary array objects during the evaluation of mathematical expressions.
However, the library's capabilities and usage were held back at the time by
the limited availability of compilers correctly implementing all the
necessary features and nuances of the \Cpp language.

In this paper we present a new method of avoiding the speed penalty in R:
using the Rcpp extension package \citep{Eddelbuettel+Francois:2011:Rcpp,
  CRAN:Rcpp} in conjunction with the \pkg{Armadillo} \Cpp linear algebra
library \citep{Sanderson:2010:Armadillo}.  In a similar manner to Blitz++,
\pkg{Armadillo} uses operator overloading and various template
meta-programming techniques to attain efficiency.  However, it has been
written to target modern \Cpp compilers as well as providing a much larger
set of linear algebra operations than Blitz++.  R programs augmented to use
\pkg{Armadillo} retain the overall structure as well as readability, all
while retaining a bidirectional link with the host R environment.

We continue the paper as follows.  In Section~\ref{sec:arma} we provide an
overview of the \pkg{Armadillo} \Cpp library, followed by its integration
with the Rcpp extension package in Section~\ref{sec:rcpparma}.  In
Section~\ref{sec:kalman} we provide an example of an R program and its
conversion to \Cpp via the use of Rcpp and \pkg{Armadillo}.
Section~\ref{sec:speed} provides an empirical timing comparison between the R
and \Cpp versions.  We conclude the paper in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.


\section{Armadillo}
\label{sec:arma}

The \pkg{Armadillo} \Cpp library provides vector, matrix and cube types
(supporting integer, floating point and complex numbers) as well as a subset
of trigonometric and statistics functions~\citep{Sanderson:2010:Armadillo}.
In addition to elementary operations such as addition and matrix
multiplication, various matrix factorisations and other commonly-used
functions are provided.  The corresponding application programming interface
(syntax) enables the programmer to write code which is both concise yet
easy-to-read to those familiar with scripting languages such as
\proglang{Matlab} and \proglang{R}.  Table~\ref{tab:arma} lists a few common
Armadillo functions.

Matrix multiplication and factorisations are accomplished through integration
with the underlying operations stemming from standard numerical libraries
such as BLAS and LAPACK~\citep{Demmel_1997}.  Similar to how environments
such as R are implemented, these underlying libraries can be replaced in a
transparent manner with variants that are optimised to the specific hardware
platform and/or multi-threaded, to automatically take advantage of the
now-common multi-core platforms~\citep{Kurzak_2010}.

%% CS: Talking about cubes and fields currentlly seems like a digression...
%%     However, cubes do add to the overall "meat" of the paper
%%
% Armadillo also provides cubes and fields. Cubes generalize matrices to three dimensions,
% and (just like vectors and matrices) can contain either integer, floating-point or
% complex types. Fields are similar to R list type as they allow the collection
% of objects of types in a single variable.

\end{table}

\pkg{Armadillo} uses a delayed evaluation approach to combine several
operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporary objects.
In contrast to brute-force evaluations, delayed evaluation can provide
considerable performance improvements as well as reduced memory usage.  The
delayed evaluation machinery accomplished through template
meta-programming~\citep{Vandevoorde_2002,Abrahams_2004}, where the \Cpp
compiler is induced to reason about mathematical expressions at {\it compile
  time}.  Where possible, the \Cpp compiler can generate machine code that is
tailored for each expression.

As an example of the possible efficiency gains, let us consider the
expression \mbox{$X = A - B + C$}, where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are matrices.  A
brute-force implementation would evaluate $A-B$ first and store the result in
a temporary matrix $T$.  The next operation would be \mbox{$T + C$}, with the
result finally stored in $X$.  The creation of the temporary matrix, and
using two separate loops for the subtraction and addition of matrix elements
is suboptimal from an efficiency point of view.

Through the overloading of mathematical operators, \pkg{Armadillo} avoids the
generation of the temporary matrix by first converting the expression into a
set of lightweight \code{Glue} objects, which only store references to the
matrices and Armadillo's representations of mathematical expressions
(eg.~other \code{Glue} objects).  To indicate that an operation comprised of
subtraction and addition is required, the exact type of the \code{Glue}
objects is automatically inferred from the given expression through template
meta-programming.  More specifically, given the expression \mbox{$X = A - B +
  C$}, \pkg{Armadillo} automatically induces the compiler to generate an
instance of the lightweight \code{Glue} storage object with the following
\Cpp {\it type}:

\centerline{~}
\centerline{\code{Glue< Glue<Mat, Mat, glue\_minus>, Mat, glue\_plus>}}
\centerline{~}

\noindent
where \code{Glue<...>} indicates that \code{Glue} is a C++ template class,
with the items between `\code{<}' and `\code{>}' specifying template
parameters; the outer \code{Glue<..., Mat, glue\_plus>} is the \code{Glue}
object indicating an addition operation, storing a reference to a matrix as
well as a reference to another \code{Glue} object; the inner \code{Glue<Mat,
  Mat, glue\_minus>} stores references to two matrices and indicates a
subtraction operation.  In both the inner and outer \code{Glue}, the type
\code{Mat} specifies that a reference to matrix object is to be held.

The expression evaluator in \pkg{Armadillo} is then automatically invoked
through the ``\code{=}'' operation, which interprets (at compile time) the
template parameters of the compound \code{Glue} object and generates \Cpp
code equivalent to:

\centerline{~}
\centerline{\code{for(int i=0; i<N; i++) \{ X[i] = (A[i] - B[i]) + C[i]; \}}}
\centerline{~}

\noindent
where $N$ is the number of elements in $A$, $B$ and $C$, with \code{A[i]}
indicating the $i$-th element in $A$.  As such, apart from the lightweight
\code{Glue} objects (for which memory is pre-allocated at compile time), no
other temporary object is generated, and only one loop is required instead of
two.  Given a sufficiently advanced \Cpp compiler, the lightweight
\code{Glue} objects can be optimised away, as they are automatically
generated by the compiler and only contain compile-time generated references;
the resultant machine code can appear as if the \code{Glue} objects never
existed in the first place.

Note that due to the ability of the \code{Glue} object to hold references to
other \code{Glue} objects, far longer and more complicated operations can be
easily accommodated.  Further discussion is of template meta-programming is
beyond the scope of this paper; for more details, the interested reader is
referred to~\cite{Vandevoorde_2002} as well as~\cite{Abrahams_2004}.


\section{RcppArmadillo}
\label{sec:rcpparma}

The \pkg{RcppArmadillo} package \citep{CRAN:RcppArmadillo} employs the Rcpp
package \citep{Eddelbuettel+Francois:2011:Rcpp,CRAN:Rcpp} to provide a
bidirectional interface between \R and \Cpp at the object level.  Using
templates, \R objects such as vectors and matrices can be mapped directly to
the corresponding \pkg{Armadillo} objects.

Consider the simple example in Listing~\ref{code:RcppArmaEx}.  Given a
vector, the \code{g()} function returns both the outer and inner products.
We load the inline package \citep{CRAN:inline}, which provides
\code{cxxfunction()} that we use to compile, link and load the \Cpp code
which is passed as the \code{body} argument.  We declare the function
signature to contain a single argument named `\code{vs}'.  On line six, this
argument is used to instantiate an \pkg{Armadillo} column vector object named
`\code{v}' (using the templated conversion function \code{as()} from Rcpp).
In lines seven and eight, the outer and inner product of the column vector
are calculated by appropriately multiplying the vector with its transpose.
This shows how the \code{*} operator for multiplication has been overloaded
to provide the appropriate operation for the types implemented by
\pkg{Armadillo}.  The inner product creates a scalar variable, and in
contrast to \R where each object is a vector type (even if of length one), we
have to explicitly convert using \code{as_scalar()} to assign the value to a
variable of type \code{double}.

+     double ip = arma::as_scalar(v.t() * v);

\end{lstlisting}

Finally, the last line creates an \R named list type containing both results.
As a result of calling \code{cxxfunction()}, a new function is created. It
contains a reference to the native code, compiled on the fly based on the
\Cpp code provided to \code{cxxfunction()} and makes it available directly
from \R under a user-assigned function name, here \code{g()}.  The listing
also shows how the \code{Rcpp} and \code{arma} namespaces are used to
disambiguate symbols from the different libraries; the \code{::} operator is
already familiar to R programmers who use the NAMESPACE directive in \R in a
similar fashion.

The listing also demonstrates how the new function \code{g()} can be called
with a suitable argument.  Here we create a vector of five elements,
containing values ranging from 7 to 11.  The function's output, here the list
containing both outer and inner product, is then displayed as it is not
assigned to a variable.

This simple example illustrates how \R objects can be transferred directly
into corresponding \pkg{Armadillo} objects using the interface code provided
by \pkg{Rcpp}.  It also shows how deployment of \pkg{RcppArmadillo} is
straightforward, even for interactive work where functions can be compiled on
the fly.  Similarly, usage in packages is also uncomplicated and follows the
documentation provided with \pkg{Rcpp}~\citep{CRAN:Rcpp}.

As of mid-2012, there are nineteen R packages on CRAN which deploy
RcppArmadillo\footnote{See
  \url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppArmadillo/}}, showing both
the usefulness of RcppArmadillo and its acceptance by the R community.


\section{Kalman Filtering Example}
\label{sec:kalman}

The Kalman filter is ubiquitous in many engineering disciplines as well as in
statistics and econometrics~\citep{Tusell:2010:Kalman}.  Even its simplest
linear form, the Kalman filter can provide simple estimates by recursively
applying linear updates which are robust to noise and can cope with missing
data.  Moreover, the estimation process is lightweight and fast, and consumes
only minimal amounts of memory as few state variables are required.

We discuss a standard example below.  The (two-dimensional) position of an
object is estimated based on past values.  A $6 \times 1$ state vector
includes $X$ and $Y$ coordinates determining the position, two variables for
speed (or velocity) $V_X$ and $V_Y$ relative to the two coordinates, as well
as two acceleration variables $A_X$ and $A_Y$.

We have the positions being updated as a function of the velocity

\begin{displaymath}
   X  = X_0 + V_X dt
   \mbox{\phantom{XX} and \phantom{XX}}
   Y  =  Y_0 + V_Y dt
\end{displaymath}

\noindent
and the velocity being updated as a function of the (unobserved) acceleration:

\begin{displaymath}
   V_x  =  V_{X,0} + A_X dt
   \mbox{\phantom{XX} and \phantom{XX}}
   V_y  = V_{Y,0} + A_Y dt
\end{displaymath}

% \begin{eqnarray*}
%   X   & = & X_0 + V_x dt \\
%   Y   & = & Y_0 + V_y dt \\
%   V_x & = & V_{x,0} + A_x dt \\
%   V_y & = & V_{y,0} + A_y dt \\
% \end{eqnarray*}

With covariance matrices $Q$ and $R$ for (Gaussian) error terms, the standard
Kalman filter estimation involves a linear prediction step resulting in a new
predicted state vector, and a new covariance estimate.  This leads to a
residuals vector and a covariance matrix for residuals which are used to
determine the (optimal) Kalman gain, which is then used to update the state
estimate and covariance matrix.

All of these steps involve only matrix multiplication and inversions, making
the algorithm very suitable for an fast implementation in any language which
can use matrix expressions. An example for \proglang{Matlab} is provided on
the Mathworks website.\footnote{See
  \url{http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-coder/demos.html?file=/products/demos/shipping/coder/coderdemo_kalman_filter.html}.}

% %The \R code below reimplements the basic linear Kalman Filter.


A straightforward \R implementation can be written as a close transcription
of the \proglang{Matlab} version; we refer to this version as
\code{FirstKalmanR} but have omitted it here for brevity.  A slightly
improved version (where several invariant statements are moved out of the
repeatedly-called function) is provided in Listing~\ref{code:Rkalman} on
page~\pageref{code:Rkalman} showing the function \code{KalmanR}.  The
estimates of the state vector and its covariance matrix are updated
iteratively.  The \proglang{Matlab} implementation uses two variables
declared `persistent' for this.  In \Rns, which does not have such an
attribute for variables, we store them in the enclosing environment of the
outer function \code{KalmanR}, which contains an inner function
\code{kalmanfilter} that is called for each observation.

\pkg{Armadillo} provides efficient vector and matrix classes to implement the
Kalman filter.  In Listing~\ref{code:CppKalmanClass} on
page~\pageref{code:CppKalmanClass}, we show a simple \Cpp class containing a
basic constructor as well as one additional member function.  The constructor
can be used to initialise all variables as we are guaranteed that the code in
the class constructor will be executed exactly once when this class is
instantiated.  A class also makes it easy to add `persistent' local
variables, which is a feature we need here.  Given such a class, the
estimation can be accessed from \R via a short and simple routine such as the
one shown in Listing~\ref{code:InlineKalman} below.

The content of Listing~\ref{code:CppKalmanClass} is assigned to a variable
\code{kalmanClass} which (on line ten) is passed to the \code{include=}
argument. This provides the required class declaration and definition.
The four lines of code in lines two to five, assigned to \code{kalmanSrc},
provide the function body required by \code{cxxfunction()}.
From both these elements and the function signature argument,
\code{cxxfunction()} creates a very simple yet efficient
\Cpp implementation of the Kalman filter which we can access from \Rns.
Given a vector of observations $Z$, it estimates a vector of position
estimates $Y$.  This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:kalmanexample} which
displays the original object trajectory (using light-coloured square
symbols) as well as the position estimates provided by the Kalman filter (using dark-coloured circles).

We note that this example is meant to be illustrative and does not attempt to
provide a reference implementation of a Kalman filter.  \proglang{R} contains
several packages providing various implementations, as discussed in the
survey provided by \cite{Tusell:2010:Kalman}.


\section{Empirical Speed Comparison}
\label{sec:speed}

Listing~\ref{code:BenchmarkKalman} contains a simple benchmarking exercise.
It compares five unique functions for implementing the Kalman filter, all
executed within the \R environment.  Specifically, we examine both the
initial \R version \code{FirstKalmanR} (mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:kalman}) as well the refactored version \code{KalmanR} shown
in Listing~\ref{code:Rkalman}.  Using the byte-code compiler introduced with
\R version 2.13.0 \citep{Tierney:2012:ByteCompiler}, we also (byte-)compile
these function creating the variants designated with a trailing `C'.
Finally, the \Cpp version shown in Listings~\ref{code:CppKalmanClass} and
\ref{code:InlineKalman} is used.

+           all.equal(KalmanR(pos), FirstKalmanR(pos)))

R> res <- benchmark(KalmanR(pos),
+                  KalmanRC(pos),

+                  order="relative",
+                  replications=100)
R>
\end{lstlisting}

Listing~\ref{code:BenchmarkKalman} shows the \R statements for creating the
byte-compiling variants via simple calls to \code{cmdfun()}.  This is
followed by a test to ensure that all variants provide equivalent results.
Next, the actual benchmark is executed with one-hundred replications of each
variant before the result is displayed.

%3  FirstKalmanR(pos)          100   8.686 88.632653

The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:benchmark}.
Byte-compiling R code provides a modest but noticeable performance gain.
However, the \code{KalmanCpp} function created using \mbox{\pkg{RcppArmadillo}} clearly outperforms all other variants;
the KalmanRC implementation in pure \R is slower by several orders of magnitude.
These results are consistent with the empirical observations made by \cite{Morandat_2012},
who also discuss several reasons for the slow speed of R compared to the C language, a close relative of C++.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduced the \pkg{RcppArmadillo} package for use within the R
statistical environment.  By using the \pkg{Rcpp} interface package,
\pkg{RcppArmadillo} brings the speed of \Cpp along with the highly expressive
\pkg{Armadillo} linear algebra library to the \R language.

A small example implementing a Kalman filter illustrated two key aspects.
First, orders of magnitude of performance gains can be obtained by deploying
\Cpp code along with \Rns.  Second, the ease of use and readability of the
corresponding C++ code is similar to the \R code from which it was derived.
This combination makes \pkg{RcppArmadillo} a compelling tool in the arsenal
of applied researchers deploying computational methods in statistical
computing and data analysis.
