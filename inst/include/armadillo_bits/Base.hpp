//! Class for static polymorphism, modelled after the "Curiously Recurring Template Pattern" (CRTP).
//! Used for type-safe downcasting in functions that restrict their input(s) to be classes that are
//! derived from Base (e.g. Mat, Op, Glue, diagview, subview).
//! A Base object can be converted to a Mat object by the unwrap class.
