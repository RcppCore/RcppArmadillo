===== typical use =====

to use RcppArmadillo, you need to create a package that : 

- contains the following line in its DESCRIPTION file: 

LinkingTo: RcppArmadillo

- contains a src/Mavevars (and src/Makevars.win) with: 

PKG_CXXFLAGS=$(shell Rscript -e "Rcpp:::CxxFlags()"|sed /^WARNING/d)
PKG_LIBS=$(shell Rscript -e "Rcpp:::LdFlags()"|sed /^WARNING/d) $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)

- include the RcppArmadillo header :

#include <RcppArmadillo.h> 



===== options : atlas and boost =====

armadillo can optionally use atlas and boost. Please refer to the 
armadillo documentation http://arma.sourceforge.net/

RcppArmadillo does not force these features. it is up to the third party package 
to enable these them for their package.

If your package wants to make use of these features, you can add a subset of 
these lines before #include <RcppArmadillo.h> 

#define ARMA_USE_BOOST
#define ARMA_USE_BOOST_DATE
#define ARMA_USE_ATLAS

when you do so, you must make sure that the corresponding features are 
available, which typically involves writing a configure file. Refer to 
Writing R Extensions for the procedure.
