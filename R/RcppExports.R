#'  Otherwise, the R programming language's RNG will be used.
#' @return The function is invoked for its side effect and has no return value.
#' @note This has been found to not work as espected in \pkg{RStudio}
#' as its code also uses the system RNG library. You may have to either
#' not run within \pkg{RStudio} or change your code to use a different RNG such 
#' as the one from R.
