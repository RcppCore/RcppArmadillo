This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-rcpparmadillo package of
RcppArmadillo, an package connect the Armadillo C++ library to R
(using the Rcpp package). RcppArmadillo was written by Romain
Francois, Dirk Eddelbuettel and Doug Bates; Armadillo was written by
Conrad Sanderson.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/
as well the R-Forge SVN host at 
	http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rcpp/
via
   	svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rcpp


The package was renamed from its upstream name 'RcppArmadillo' to
'r-cran-rcpparmadillo' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for
R.

   Description: R and Armadillo integration using Rcpp
    Armadillo is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad Sanderson)
    that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
    floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
    trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
    provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
    .
    A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine 
    several operations into one, and to reduce (or eliminate) the need for 
    temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template 
    meta-programming.   
    .
    This library is useful if C++ has been decided as the language of choice 
    (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language.
    .
    The RcppArmadillo package includes the header files from the templated
    Armadillo library (currently version 3.800.1). Thus users do not need to
    install Armadillo itself in order to use RcppArmadillo.
    .
    This Armadillo integration provides a nice illustration of the 
    capabilities of the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++ integration.
    .
    Armadillo is licensed under the MPL 2.0, while RcppArmadillo (the Rcpp 
    bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 
    or later, as is the rest of Rcpp.
