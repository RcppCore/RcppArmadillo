## With R 3.1.0 or later, you can uncomment the following line to tell R to 
## enable compilation with C++11 (where available)
##
## Also, OpenMP support in Armadillo prefers C++11 support. However, for wider
## availability of the package we do not yet enforce this here.  It is however
## recommended for client packages to set it.
##
#CXX_STD = CXX11

## Armadillo itself use the following define which we also set
## automatically if we see USE_CXX1X defined; outside of a package it
## may be needed explicitly
## In general, this can be enabled here via
##    PKG_CXXFLAGS = -DARMA_USE_CXX11
## or via 
##    #define ARMA_USE_CXX11 
## before RcppArmadillo.h is included
