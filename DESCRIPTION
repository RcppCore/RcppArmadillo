Title: 'Rcpp' Integration for the 'Armadillo' Templated Linear Algebra Library
Version: 0.7.300.1.0

Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel, Romain Francois and Doug Bates

Description: 'Armadillo' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad
 Sanderson) that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
 floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
 trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
 provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
 The 'RcppArmadillo' package includes the header files from the templated
 'Armadillo' library. Thus users do not need to install 'Armadillo' itself in
 order to use 'RcppArmadillo'. 'Armadillo' is licensed under the MPL 2.0, while
 'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under the
 GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'.
