Description: R and Armadillo integration using Rcpp
 Armadillo is a templated C++ linear algebra library aiming towards a good
 balance between speed and ease of use. Integer, floating point and complex
 numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics
 functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional
 integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
 .
 A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine 
 several operations into one, and to reduce (or eliminate) the need for 
 temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template 
 meta-programming.   
 .
 This library is useful if C++ has been decided as the language of choice 
 (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language.
 .
 The RcppArmadillo package includes the header files from the templated
 Armadillo library. Thus users do not need to install Armadillo itself in
 order to use RcppArmadillo.
 .
 This Armadillo integration provides a nice illustration of the 
 capabilities of the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++ integration.
