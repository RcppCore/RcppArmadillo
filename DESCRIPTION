Description: R and Armadillo integration using Rcpp
 Armadillo is a C++ linear algebra library aiming towards a good balance 
 between speed and ease of use. Integer, floating point and complex 
 numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics
 functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional 
 integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
 .
 A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine 
 several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the need for 
 temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template 
 meta-programming.   
 .
 This library is useful if C++ has been decided as the language of choice 
 (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language.
 .
 This Armadillo / C integration provides a nice illustration of the 
 capabilities of the Rcpp package for seamless R and C++ integration/
