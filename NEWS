0.2.0   (under development)

    o   fastLm is now generic and has a formula interface as well as methods
	    for print, summary, predict to behave like a standard model fitting 
		function

    o   Armadillo sources (using release 0.9.6) are now included in the package
   	    using a standardized build suitable for our purposes (not assuming
   	    Boost or Atlas) -- see ?RcppArmadillo for details
   	
   	o	New R function RcppArmadillo.package.skeleton, similar to 
   	    Rcpp::Rcpp.package.skeleton, but targetting use of RcppArmadillo
   	

0.1.0	2010-03-11

    o	the fastLm() implementation of a bare-bones lm() fit
 	    (using Armadillo's solve() function) provides an example
	    of how efficient code can be written compactly using 
	    the combination of Rcpp, RcppAramadillo and Armadillo

    o	support for Rcpp implicit wrap of these types :
    	Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T>, Cube<T> where T is one of : 
    	int, unsigned int, double, float
    	
    o	support for Rcpp implicit as of these types :
    	Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T> where R is one of :
    	int, unsigned int, double, float
