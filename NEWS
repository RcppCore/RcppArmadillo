0.1.0	2010-03-11

    o	the fastLm() implementation of a bare-bones lm() fit
	(using Armadillo's solve() function) provides an example
	of how efficient code can be written compactly using 
	the combination of Rcpp, RcppAramadillo and Armadillo

    o	support for Rcpp implicit wrap of these types :
    	Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T>, Cube<T> where T is one of : 
    	int, unsigned int, double, float
    	
    o	support for Rcpp implicit as of these types :
    	Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T> where R is one of :
    	int, unsigned int, double, float
