0.2.7   TBD

    o   Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.80 "Chihuahua Muncher":

         * Added join_slices(), insert_slices(), shed_slices()
         * Added in-place operations on diagonals
         * Various speedups due to internal architecture improvements

0.2.6   2010-09-12

    o   Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.70 "Subtropical Winter Safari"
    
    o	arma::Mat, arma::Row and arma::Col get constructor that take vector
    	or matrix sugar expressions. See the unit test "test.armadillo.sugar.ctor" 
    	and "test.armadillo.sugar.matrix.ctor" for examples.

0.2.5   2010-08-05

    o   Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.60 "Killer Bush Turkey"

0.2.4   2010-07-27

    o   Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.52 'Monkey Wrench'

    o   src/fastLm.cpp: Switch from inv() to pinv() as inv() now tests for
        singular matrices and warns and returns an empty matrix which stops
        the example fastLm() implementation on the manual page -- and while
        this is generally reasonably it makes sense here to continue which
        the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse allows us to do this

0.2.3   2010-06-14

    o   Better configuration to detect suncc (which does not have std::isfinite)

0.2.2	2010-06-09

    o   Added RcppArmadillo:::CxxFlags for cases where RcppArmadillo is 
        not used via a package

    o   Upgraded to Armadillo 0.9.10 'Chilli Espresso'

    o   Wrap support for mtOp, i.e. operations involving mixed types such 
        as a complex and an arma::mat, which have been introduced in
        armadillo 0.9.10
        
    o   Wrap support for mtGlue, i.e. operations involving matrices of mixed 
        types such as an arma::mat and an arma::imat, which have been introduced
        in armadillo 0.9.10
        
    o   Included an inline plugin to support the plugin system introduced
        in inline 0.3.5. The unit tests have moved from the src directory 
        to the unit test directory (similar to Rcpp) using cxxfunction with the
        RcppArmadillo plugin. 
        
0.2.1   2010-05-19

    o   Bug-fix release permitting compilation on Windows

0.2.0   2010-05-18

    o   fastLm() is now generic and has a formula interface as well as
        methods for print, summary, predict to behave like a standard
        model fitting function

    o   Armadillo sources (using release 0.9.8) are now included in the
        package using a standardized build suitable for our purposes
        (not assuming Boost or Atlas) -- see ?RcppArmadillo for
        details
        
   o    New R function RcppArmadillo.package.skeleton, similar to
        Rcpp::Rcpp.package.skeleton, but targetting use of
        RcppArmadillo

0.1.0   2010-03-11

    o   the fastLm() implementation of a bare-bones lm() fit (using
        Armadillo's solve() function) provides an example of how
        efficient code can be written compactly using the combination
        of Rcpp, RcppAramadillo and Armadillo

    o   support for Rcpp implicit wrap of these types :
        Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T>, Cube<T> where T is one of : 
        int, unsigned int, double, float
        
    o   support for Rcpp implicit as of these types :
        Mat<T>, Col<T>, Row<T> where R is one of :
        int, unsigned int, double, float
