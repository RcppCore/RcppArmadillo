  R and Armadillo Integration
}
\description{
  The package brings the power of Armadillo to R.

\section{Armadillo}{
  \code{Armadillo} is a C++ linear algebra library, aiming towards a good
  balance between speed and ease of use.

  It provides efficient classes for vectors, matrices and cubes, as well
  as many functions which operate on the classes (eg. contiguous and
  non-contiguous submatrix views).

  Various matrix decompositions are provided, and an automatic
  expression evaluator (via template meta-programming) combines several
  operations to increase efficiency.
 
  The syntax (API) is deliberately similar to Matlab. It is useful for
  algorithm development directly in C++, or quick conversion of research
  code into production environments.
 
  Armadillo has been primarily developed at NICTA (Australia) by Conrad
  Sanderson, with contributions from around the world.

\section{RcppArmadillo}{
  \code{RcppArmadillo} acts as a bridge between \code{Rcpp} and \code{Armadillo}, 
  allowing the programmer to write code using Armadillo classes that integrate
  seemlessly with \code{R} via \code{Rcpp}.

\section{Using RcppArmadillo}{
  The simplest way to get started is to create a skeleton of a package
  using \code{RcppArmadillo}. This can be done conveniently by the
  \code{\link{RcppArmadillo.package.skeleton}}
  function. 

  The important steps are
  \itemize{
    \item Include the \code{RcppArmadillo.h} header file, which also includes
    \code{armadillo.h}.
    \item Import Rcpp, and LinkingTo Rcpp and RcppArmadillo by adding these lines to 
    the DESCRIPTION file: 

    \preformatted{
      Imports: Rcpp (>= 0.11.0)
      LinkingTo: Rcpp, RcppArmadillo
    }

    \item Link against the BLAS and LAPACK libraries, by adding this line
    in the \code{Makevars} and \code{Makevars.win} files:
    \preformatted{PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) }
  }
}
